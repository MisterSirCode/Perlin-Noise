# Perlin-Noise-CS
CSharp Perlin Noise class (In C#) transcribed from this Java-based class [raxod502/TerrariaClone (PerlinNoise.java)](https://github.com/raxod502/TerrariaClone/blob/master/src/PerlinNoise.java)

I made use of this library to generate surface terrain for my game "Deepworld Remastered" in the Unity Game Engine.

**This was made in the Unity editor, but should work in essentially any C# project.**
